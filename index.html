<b>Hi!</b> My name is Ada. In ~decreasing order of average non-sleeping hours spent per month, I am a software engineer/AI researcher,
friend, household chore doer, and book/internet reader.
I have started this site because I have read many people explain how the practice of writing makes you a better thinker, and I want to be a better thinker.
Please enjoy your stay.
