<h3>Professional</h3>
<p>
I'm Ada Martin, a machine learning researcher at Anthropic.
Previously, I was at FAIR where I worked on <a href="https://locate3d.atmeta.com/">Locate 3D</a> (dataset lead / ICML 2025 spotlight) and <a href="https://ai.meta.com/vjepa/">V-JEPA 2</a>.
These papers aimed to make progress on the data scarcity problem of robotics.
I try to work on whatever problems seem impactful, but I have a soft spot for research related to loss specification -- dataset creation, (model-based) RL, self-supervised learning.
</p>
<p>
I have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ada-martin-cmu/">LinkedIn</a>, and I can usually be found in-person in San Francisco.
</p>
<h3>Personal</h3>
<p>
My interests aside from machine learning vary wildly from month to month and have recently included:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Emulators (see <a href="https://github.com/adaGrad1/gbemu">this little gameboy emu project</a>)</li>
    <li>Music composition; I want to write like toby fox</li>
    <li>Running</li>
    <li>Abstract algebra (currently about halfway through <a href="https://archive.org/details/charles-c-pinter-a-book-of-abstract-algebra">Pinter</a>)</li>
</ul>
You should feel free to email me at ga[mylastname]@alumni.cmu.edu
I am generally excited to have conversations with people who share my interests!
