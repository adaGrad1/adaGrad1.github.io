Taking courses after college

<h3>why</h3>
<p>
Since graduating from university in 2023, I've tried to keep up the habit of learning new things in an "academic" manner.
It feels a little silly sometimes to come home from my day job as a software engineer only to unwind with some
computer science courses. But I do think it is useful and easy to compartmentalize the two --
I want to be free to learn new ideas that might sit idle for years before being highly relevant.
</p>
<p>
I see many paradigm-shifting, <b>beautiful</b> machine learning papers follow a certain format: they take some well-established
ML problem and throw a well-established technique from an adjacent field at it, maybe with a sprinkling of good model architecture.
DDPMs are absolutely an example of this. LoRA is another good example. The S4 line of work is
really exciting to me too, though it hasn't taken off quite as much as I expected a few years ago.
</p>
<p>
This is more or less why I try to make an effort to learn new things from adjacent fields, even if the connections to ML are unclear.
I want to do good research!
Humanity has produced so many great ideas, beautiful abstractions, deep insights, and only a miniscule fraction were
originally generated in the field of AI.
Aside from that, I think I often overflow with type-A energy, but I have learned it is not a very good idea to do work for my job
non-stop. I get tunnel vision. So doing little courses in my free time is one other outlet for my desire to "push" somehow.

<h3>how and what</h3>
<p>
<b>Computer Science</b> courses are generally fairly easy to complete on my own. Many, many popular courses from
Carngie Mellon have public course archives for a semi-recent incarnation of the course. I think these courses are also
primarily easy to self-teach precisely because it is close to what I studied in university. During my first programming
courses, I really grappled with what it meant to give a proof -- how to come up with one, what constituted ironclad
mathematical reasoning. And later, during the start of my master's, I really grappled with what it means to do research,
even to the basic/condensed extent necessary for class projects. How do you identify a gap in the literature? How do you
address it? How do you design experiments?

<p>
So far, I've only done CMU's 15-213 independently, which was a fairly seamless
experience (other than the autograder totally disagreeing with my web browser on the final homework). I've just started
CMU's 15-150 (functional programming), for which someone uploaded all of the homeworks 8 years ago. Though, I've already
run into issues on the first lab and homework, where the SML files give errors (or don't give errors when they're supposed to).
Maybe it's a version issue? But then, it's not clear which version I should use.

To identify which courses I should even complete, I tend to look at the requirements for a major in that course at some
university to understand what the fundamentals are. From there, I find
